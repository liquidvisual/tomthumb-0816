vision: <p>Agribusiness Association of Australia wanted to rebrand to coincide with a new constitution and direction of advocacy. The association started 25 years ago and is the peak body that represents agribusiness in Australia.</p>

strategy_execution: <p>Working with their board and CEO a thorough understanding of the change in the organisations direction and their strategy to be positioned as the leading voice for agribusiness in Australia was gained. This was interpreted into a new brand core as well as the development of a Brand Story to educate the market about the association. The organisation was renamed Agribusiness Australia.</p><p>A new identity was developed that would visually sit the organisation comfortably within their major member organisations. A new tagline of “Advancing Agribusiness in Australia” was also adopted. A reskin of their current website and development of a new corporate brochure was also undertaken as well as enabling the identity to be used for presentation and video content.</p>
