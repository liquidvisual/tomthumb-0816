vision: <p>Stellar is Australia’s largest multi-channel customer contact centre group and the most awarded business in their sector looking after a large number of Australia’s most recognised brands across government and commercial enterprise. With 4,500 employees across the region and a rapid growth strategy, their executive team believed their brand did not reflect the evolving organisation and where the business needed to be positioned for the future.</p>

strategy_execution: <p>We undertook extensive research into their market and spent weeks absorbing their culture through meetings with the CEO and leadership team down to frontline staff around Australia.</p><p>We talked to their customers and delved deep into their organisational structure. Out of this we developed a new Brand in conjunction with their lead team. Stellar is very much a people business and they wanted to reflect who they were in an emotional sense. To provide this, we developed a Brand Story so that any staff member could understand and be proud of Stellar’s values and vision.</p>
