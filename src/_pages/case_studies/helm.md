vision: <p>Helm is a leading Sydney property developer providing a lasting social legacy through the delivery of architecturally designed buildings that are balanced and beautifully proportioned. Their vision is to create luxury residences that are spacious, livable, functional and of extremely high quality.</p>

strategy_execution: <p>We worked with the Helm executive team to choose the name then develop the brand identity for their latest development. Following that we worked on the look and feel that would role across all elements required to create interest and sales in the properties. This creative went across a website, property brochure, press advertisements, direct mailer, outdoor signage and other collateral.</p><p>Launched in late June 2014, sixteen of the eighteen apartments sold off plan in the first weekend. By three weeks all apartments sold. Tom Thumb is currently working on their next three developments.</p>
