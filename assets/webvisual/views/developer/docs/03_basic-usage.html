<h2 id="integrating-into-your-cms">Integrating into your CMS</h2>
<p>Let’s assume the client has signed off on the design and the front-end implementation. All that’s left now, is to incorporate into your own CMS. In a typical scenario, the third party would be handing over a zipped directory of static files, it’s then the developer’s job to figure out how everything is structured before breaking it down into template files.</p>
<p>If you prefer that workflow, then by all means continue on as you’re familiar. You can download a zip of that folder here:</p>

<h3 id="use-the-source-luke">Use the Source, Luke</h3>
<p>Admittedly it takes a lot of time doing that, and code tends to get soupy. You’re going to have a much better time working with and understanding the source files.
    <strong>This doesn’t mean you have to learn Jekyll or Ruby.</strong> It also doesn’t mean you need to have anything installed, you can simply work from the Github repo. All you need to understand is how it slots together on a basic level.</p>
<p>The benefits of working with the source is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML partials have already been broken up for you.</li>
    <li>Template heirarchy has been thought out and organised for you.</li>
    <li>Basic template logic is already written.</li>
    <li>Content is separated from the layout.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquid-as-a-basic-templating-engine">Liquid as a Basic Templating Engine</h3>
<p>The only real major difference between this and your CMS of choice is template syntax. Jekyll uses a very basic templating engine called
    <a href="http://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> which should be transferrable to any environment. Ideally, once you’ve gotten the hang of reading our templates - you’ll be able to breeze through, copy-pasting everything and substituting the basic templating syntax for your own.</p>
<div class="spacer m-b-2"></div>
<h3 id="the-output-is-still-there-if-you-need-it">The Output is Still There If You Need It</h3>
<p>The compiled source files are stored in a directory named
    <strong>/dist</strong> - which doesn’t come with the cloned repo by default (you would need to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">grunt build</code> to generate this folder locally). You can find the contents of this folder on the
    <a href="https://github.com/liquidvisual/tomthumb-0816/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">github-pages branch</a>.</p>
<div class="spacer m-b-2"></div>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>
<div class="spacer m-b-2"></div>
<h3 id="copy-assets-folder">01. Copy Assets Folder</h3>
<p>Jump into the
    <a href="https://github.com/liquidvisual/tomthumb-0816/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">dist directory</a> and copy the
    <strong>/assets</strong> folder. This contains all compiled CSS, fonts, images and JavaScript.
    <strong>Place it into your project’s root directory</strong>. This is important, since all paths are root relative to the
    <strong>/assets</strong> folder.</p>
<div class="spacer m-b-2"></div>
<h3 id="copy-html-partials">02. Copy HTML Partials</h3>
<p>All partials are found inside
    <a href="https://github.com/liquidvisual/tomthumb-0816/tree/master/src/_includes" target="_blank">src/_includes</a>. Layouts will reference partials from inside this folder so copy them into your environment.</p>
<div class="spacer m-b-2"></div>
<h3 id="create-base-layout">03. Create Base Layout</h3>
<p>You’ll want to start by creating a base layout in your environment. Open
    <a href="https://github.com/liquidvisual/tomthumb-0816/blob/master/src/_layouts/base.html" target="_blank">base.html</a> and copy the contents. Make sure to substitute any template logic for your own. When it comes to assets, they compile into
    <strong>/assets</strong> on build so you’ll only need to do a bit of substitution.</p>
<p>You can replace this:</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">&lt;!-- build:css /assets/css/minified.css --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/some-css-file.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/some-css-file.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/some-css-file.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/some-css-file.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/css/some-css-file.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- endbuild --&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With this:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/minified.css"&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The same applies to JavaScript. The end result will look like this:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;script src="/assets/scripts/minified.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- Before closing body --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-child-layouts">04. Create Child Layouts</h3>
<p>Once your
    <strong>base.html</strong> is in place and pointing to your assets correctly, you can then move through the child layouts one by one - again, substituting Liquid template syntax for your own. At this stage, you should be able to view your website as it starts taking shape.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to start integrating editable content fields, you can start pulling data from the markdown files inside
    <a href="https://github.com/liquidvisual/tomthumb-0816/tree/master/src/_pages" target="_blank">_pages</a>. These markdown files contain YAML variables which serve as your content hooks.</p>
